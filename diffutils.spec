%description
Diffutils includes four utilities:  diff, cmp, diff3 and sdiff.

  * Diff compares two files and shows the differences, line by line.
  * The cmp command shows the offset and line numbers where two files differ,
    or cmp can show the characters that differ between the two files.
  * The diff3 command shows the differences between three files. Diff3 can be
    used when two people have made independent changes to a common original;
    diff3 can produce a merged file that contains both persons' changes and
    warnings about conflicts.
  * The sdiff command can be used to list diff of two files side by side or
    merge two files interactively.

Install diffutils if you need to compare text files.
